# daVinci Inroduction

Welcome to the documentation for **Project daVinci**. This project provides advanced data analysis for a variety of applications, although we generally focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

## About

daVinci is a software that combines a variety of advanced data analysis techniques in a stream-of-consciousness way for researchers, and some end users. The basic concept of the software is to transform the data from what it is easily stored as into what it is easily understood as. daVinci is named after the famous polymath due to his way of doing just that. On one hand, Leonardo da Vinci studied a lot of the phenomena that this software stands to understand better. On the other hand, this software is never really quite done.

In this documentation, we will endeavor to do a few things:

1. Explain the methdology, the math and science behind the software.
2. Showcase the software's capabilities as far as we can.
3. Provide a basis to discuss these concepts openly.

So, with all that said, here:
