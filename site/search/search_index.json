The basic concept of the software is to transform the data from what it is easily stored as into what it is easily understood as. daVinci is named after the famous polymath due to his way of doing just that. On one hand, Leonardo da Vinci studied a lot of the phenomena that this software stands to understand better. On the other hand, this software is never really quite done.</p> <p>In this documentation, we will endeavor to do a few things:</p> <ol> <li>Explain the methdology, the math and science behind the software.</li> <li>Showcase the software's capabilities as far as we can.</li> <li>Provide a basis to discuss these concepts openly.</li> </ol> <p>So, with all that said, here:</p>"},{"location":"#topics","title":"Topics","text":"<p>Scientific Data Reading</p> <ul> <li>Sources</li> <li>File Storage</li> </ul> <p>Computer Vision and Feature Recognition</p> <ul> <li>Edge Detection</li> </ul> <p>Data Transformations</p> <ul> <li>Interpolation</li> <li>Spectral Methods</li> <li>Multiresolution Methods</li> <li>Prinicipal Component Analysis</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#libraries","title":"Libraries","text":"<p>transform_lib</p> <p>finance</p> <p>sciDataRead</p>"},{"location":"#editing-the-documentation","title":"Editing the Documentation","text":"<p>It will be helpful to note a few things about how to alter this documentation.</p> <p>First, all the sources go in references.bib. If we need to add more files, we can add them in itemized form below plugins -&gt; bibtex -&gt; bibfiles.</p> <p>Second, we can add as many pages as we want. In general, try to keep each page its own markdown file and link to it. </p>"},{"location":"topics/edge_detection/","title":"Overview of Topic","text":"<p>Rather than discussing the already established ideas in this area, I will simply reference you to Geeks of Geeks, who do a good job at explaining the topic. One may notice that each of these algorithms are simply the convolution of a kernel that reflects the edge shape amongst the data. Thus, one can use the simple formulation:</p> \\[ Ax=b \\] \\[ Ax=b \\]"}]}
